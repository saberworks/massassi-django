# License

## Background

This repo contains python/django code that runs the dynamic backend of Massassi.  The license below applies only to the files in this repo.  It doesn't apply to any content or data on The Massassi Temple (I didn't write most of it so I can't possibly license it out to anyone!).  Each related repo has its own license.
